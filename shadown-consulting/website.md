Project: Create a complete, multi-page website for a political consultancy firm based in India.

Company Name: Shadow Consulting

Overall Vibe & Aesthetic:

    Trustworthy & Authoritative: The design should inspire confidence and professionalism. Use a clean, modern, and uncluttered layout.

    Patriotic & Energetic: Incorporate a subtle Indian aesthetic. Use colors that evoke trust (deep blues, whites) and energy (saffron, green) but do NOT mimic any specific political party's flag. Think elegant accents, not overwhelming blocks of color.

    Modern & Data-Driven: The feel should be sleek and tech-savvy, reflecting our use of data analytics and modern campaign tools. Use high-quality, professional stock photos of diverse groups of Indian people, strategic meetings, and tech interfaces (like data dashboards and maps). Avoid clich√© or overly dramatic political imagery.

Color Palette:

    Primary: Navy Blue (for trust, stability), Clean White (for clarity, honesty).

    Accents: Saffron Orange (energy, action), Forest Green (growth, connection), Gold (quality, success). Use accents sparingly in buttons, headings, and highlights.

Typography:

    Headings: A strong, modern sans-serif font (e.g., something like Poppins or Montserrat).

    Body Text: A very readable, clean sans-serif or serif font.
